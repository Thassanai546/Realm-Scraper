This program allows you to quickly search for information about Realm of the Mad God and its players. 
This web scraper is powered by [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/). I use [RealmEye](https://www.realmeye.com/) to search for public information about players and characters.

This is the first web scraper I have made since I started learning Python and Beautiful Soup.

On the left is a screenshot of the program where I searched for my own name. First a summary of my account is displayed. Information like my account age, number of characters and positions on leader boards are displayed.

Below the summary is a list of my characters and the gear that they have equipped. Next to the screenshot of the terminal is an in-game screenshot of my characters.

This screenshot shows me filtering the "Warrior" class and choosing 8 maxed stats (the power of the character). The result is that only 8/8 Warriors are shown.
